Project Title: Bond Yield Calculator

Description:
The Bond Yield Calculator is a Java application designed to calculate the Yield to Maturity (YTM) of a bond based on user-provided parameters such as bond price, coupon rate, face value, and years to maturity. This application utilizes an iterative approach to approximate the YTM through trial and error, ensuring a high level of accuracy within a specified tolerance.

Features:

Calculates the Yield to Maturity (YTM) of a bond.
Accepts user input for bond price, coupon rate, face value, and years to maturity.
Utilizes an iterative algorithm to iteratively adjust the interest rate guess until the present value matches the provided bond price within a specified tolerance.
How to Use:

Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
Compile the BondYieldCalculator.java file using the command:
Copy code
javac BondYieldCalculator.java
Run the compiled Java class using the command:
Copy code
java BondYieldCalculator
Follow the on-screen instructions to input the required parameters: bond price, coupon rate, face value, and years to maturity.
The application will then calculate and display the Yield to Maturity (YTM) of the bond based on the provided parameters.
Sample Usage:

yaml
Copy code
Enter bond price:
1000
Enter coupon rate:
0.05
Enter face value:
1000
Enter years to maturity:
5
Yield to Maturity (YTM): 0.0512
